Use the provided files:

- docs/safespace-spec.yaml

- docs/SafeSpace-UseCases.pdf

Analyze both documents to understand system structure (from the YAML spec)

and user flows (from the PDF scenarios).  

Build on the existing Laravel + React + ShadCN + spatie/permissions for roles:

1. Authentication & onboarding flows:

   - Guardians & Therapists register with "pending" status.

   - Admin approves accounts.

   - Guardians can create child accounts (pending admin approval).

2. Dashboards:

   - Role-specific dashboards for Admin, Therapist, Guardian, and Child.

3. API:

   - Endpoints as listed in the spec, consistent with user actions described in the PDF.

4. Frontend routes:

   - Each role is redirected to its dashboard after login.

Ensure routes, controllers, and views align with the workflows and emotional design in the scenarios.

5. A nice landing page to welcome and easily show and tell about the app and how they can proceed is important.
  
  - For an example use link https://ea90407e-104c-49e1-9d74-60fb0abee5a8-00-156hyf0urzaut.picard.replit.dev/ and also see the screenshots in the "docs/screenshots" folder
  
  - Be creative about the landing page.
